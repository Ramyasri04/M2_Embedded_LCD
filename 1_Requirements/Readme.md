## About seat heating:

Heated seats are powered by a heating element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor. A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows through it, the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.

## Research:
The heat dissipation of car seat back is poor if there is no extra ventilation system. Various TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) methods were used, such as Function Model, Cause and Effect Chain, Contradiction Analysis, Substance Field and SLP (smart little people) and so on. All these methods were used by a logical structured process (ARIZ) which incrementally evolves the complex problem to a point where it was simple to solve.

## Features:
- Rapid heating and maintaining optimal temperature in the vehicle compartment over time.

- Easy installation.

- Protection against hypothermia. This is one of the main tasks of heated seats. 

- Sitting in the cold is not the best health condition, especially in winter, when the temperature is very low outside, you need to warm up quickly in the car so as not to catch a cold and get sick.

- Back warming is also very useful in certain diseases, for example, sciatica. For drivers with such problems, the use of heating can be shown even in the warm season.
